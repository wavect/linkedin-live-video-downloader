# linkedin-live-video-downloader
Download LinkedIn Video Live events to your local device. Make sure you have the permission to do so (only download your own videos)!

## Get started
1. Update `initialUrl` in the `main()` function.
2. `npm i`
3. `node download.js`
4. Manually log-in on the opened browser window.
5. Wait until the video has been fully played (limitation by LinkedIn unfortunately).

## Why this exists
We occassionally weren't able or forgot to record our live streams on LinkedIn and couldn't then e.g. create Shorts out of it afterwards since we didn't have the local file.
